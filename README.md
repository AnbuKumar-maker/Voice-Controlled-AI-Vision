# Voice-Controlled-AI-Vision
This project will present the architectural design behind a voice controlled AI camera. The main idea is to control a camera by a voice interface to take a photo and have it send you an email with the photo description of what it observes. The project encompasses multiple components starting from hardware modules like Matrix Voice, Jetson Nano and RPIU2 to software frameworks like SNIPS AI and of course custom Python AI scripts that comprise the neural backend engine.  So in a nutshell we will leverage the Snips AI platform and Matrix Voice for the voice interface and Keras/Tenorflow DNN running on a Jetson Nano SBC for the image inference AI.  The demo code attached is setup so that if a person is detected an email is sent to the user with the annotated image from the AI engine. The class can be changed however.
